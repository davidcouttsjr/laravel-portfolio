		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>As key stakeholders consisting of practicing Web professionals, experienced educators, community and business leaders we have an obligation to do better. We need to challenge one another and commit to a course of action that will improve student outcomes and a better prepared work force for tomorrow's workplace needs.</p>

		<p>For example:</p>
		<ul>
        	<li>Practicing Web professionals want access to the most relevant training resources to accomplish their goals including the skills and technologies that employers want and need the most.</li>
			<li>Students want to know that they are getting an excellent education that prepares them for meaningful employment.</li>
			<li>Teachers want to make sure their instruction is on-target and to know ìwhat worksî while seeking and receiving support to help them improve their practice through better curriculum and partnerships.</li>
			<li>Education program managers want help developing good site level plans so they can help teachers effectively implement change that will produce results, happy and successful students and good will in the community.</li>
			<li>Policy decision makers want to see improved results on a limited budget and time constraints.</li>
        </ul>
        
		<p>Web Design, Web Development and New Media are integral parts of modern life. The Web profession offers a dynamic and entrepreneurial working environment that has had a revolutionary impact on the global economy and on society. Among its most important functions are the efficient transmission of information, storage and analysis of information and display through computer networks and systems, the Internet, and computer databases. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the demand for Web and New Media professionals will continue to be strong as more of these workers will be needed to accommodate the increasing amount of data sent and number of devices over the Internet, as well as the growing number of Internet users.</p>

		<h2 id="how_it_got_started">How did the SchoolofWeb.org get started and why?</h2>
        <p>Back in 1996, the WebProfessionals.org WebProfessionals.org aka ìWorld Organization of Webmastersî association was founded. Its founders and its supporters have been advocating on behalf educational resources for Web professionals and those that teach ever since.</p>

		<h2 id="goals">What are the goals of the SchoolofWeb.org?</h2>
		<p>The School of Web is an industry wide partnership initiative that aims to support careers in the Web profession.</p>

		<h2 id="why_it_matters">Why the SchoolofWeb.org Matters to Students, Teachers, Business and Industry and those that Hire</h2>
        <p>The initiative is responding to a crisis of record unemployment, a higher than average drop out rate and U.S. government studies predicting a significant shortage of technology and New Media professionals within the next three to five years. The new initiative is designed to address the shortage of technology professionals and to answer the question, "Why Consider a Career in the Web Profession?"</p>
		<p>"In order for the U.S. to continue to lead the world in innovation and creativity, we must develop an advanced information technology ecosystem that is able to refresh itself with technology and design talent and creative thinkers and entrepreneurs." said Bill Cullifer, WOW Executive Director and Webprofessionals.org.</p>

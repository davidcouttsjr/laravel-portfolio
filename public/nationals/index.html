        <h2>What is the SchoolofWeb.org all about?</h2>
        <p>Leading Web professionals with expertise in Computer Science, Art and Interactive Design, business, education and government have come together to collaborate on a new initiative that will help advocate on behalf of and support interdisciplinary education in the areas of Web design, technology, and business.</p>
		<p>The goal of the SchoolofWeb.org initiative is to support students and teachers with an advanced interdisciplinary education ecosystem that is able to refresh itself with technology and design talent, creative thinkers and entrepreneurs. The membership supported WebProfessionals.org organization is pleased to announce the formation and the SchoolofWeb.org to foster improvements in interdisciplinary education within secondary and post secondary education with pathways to jobs.</p>

		<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
		<p>The initiative is responding to a crisis of record unemployment, a higher than average drop out rate and U.S. government studies predicting a significant shortage of technology and New Media professionals within the next three to five years. The new initiative is designed to address the shortage of technology professionals and to answer the question, "Why Consider a Career in the Web Profession?"</p>
		<p>"In order for the U.S. to continue to lead the world in innovation and creativity, we must develop an advanced information technology ecosystem that is able to refresh itself with technology and design talent and creative thinkers and entrepreneurs." said Bill Cullifer, WOW Executive Director and Webprofessionals.org.</p>

		<h2>How will we accomplish our goals?</h2>
		<p>The SchoolofWeb.org initiative will advocate and promote interdisciplinary education and development and teacher resources that will support students in the classroom. It also will:</p>
		<ul>
        	<li>Develop an effective communication strategy to articulate why interdisciplinary education is good for business, commerce, competitiveness and jobs</li>
			<li>Collaboration: Improve collaboration between the Computer Science, Art and Business departments within secondary and higher education</li>
			<li>Improve collaboration between K-12, community colleges, 4-year colleges an universities, business and government</li>
			<li>Aggregate an effective advocacy effort with state and national policy makers on behalf of the Web professional community in communities around the globe</li>
			<li>Deploy relevant, workable, accessible instructional design strategies for learners (traditional and online methods) in partnership with education including high schools, community colleges and universities</li>
        </ul>
